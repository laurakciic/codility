## Notes & Thoughts

## setup
- although Codility offers a pretty decent environment, I still sometimes prefer my own, as it's faster to write code in IntelliJ, VS, VS Code etc. which has extensions that help cut the time writing the code

- a big plus is the testing interface where you write only test inputs in separate lines and compile the code to see if they will pass the test cases 


## problems and how I manage them
- time limitation is pretty discouraging for me, because sometimes I spend a lot of time to read & understand the task and to actually code it (sometimes first more than the other)

- what I like to do to preserve time is to basically write the code in my `IDE`, copy it into the `Codility environment` and test it with their `testing interface`

- also every task has a detailed description with a few test examples which help me understand the task and to make sure there aren't hidden tricky stuff

- pen & paper is a traditional but very efficient technique to break down the task into small segments which help solve it

- to choose between preffered languages is indeed such a big plus, but sometimes I get lost in thinking which is the most `optimal` one for the given task

- once I switched languages mid writing the code so I lost a bit of time there also


## my solved tasks
- I have solved some interesting Codility tasks, but because of the Codility's `Code of Honour` they are not publicly available
